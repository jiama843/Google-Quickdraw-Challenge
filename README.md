# Google-Quickdraw-Challenge
Algorithm for the 2018 Google quickdraw doodle recognition challenge.

***This implementation is completely built without forking from an existing kernel. The main purpose of this exercise was to be able gain in depth knowledge on implementing an LSTM model***

Idea: Use an LSTM approach to predicting the test set for google quickdraw data.
